1. install Mambaforge:

    https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge

2. Clone this github repository:

    https://github.com/arian-dialectaquiz/opendrift_lhico.git


3. Create environment with the required dependencies and install OpenDrift

    cd opendrift_lhico/
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate opendrift
    pip install --no-deps -e .

4. Choose the eulerian model to be used:
    opendrift_ecom
    opendrift_roms

  4.1. Check if the necessary grid data has been downloaded. This is needed to mask land data in ECOM and to make angle rotation in ROMS.

    cd opendrift_ecom/opendrift/readers/ECOM_dependencies

    cd opendrift_ROMS/opendrift/readers/roms_grid

  4.2. Understand the readers and change as will, but keep the stable version unchanged.

    cd opendrift_ecom/opendrift/readers/
      reader_ECOM_S2Z_many_grids_stable
    cd opendrift_roms/opendrift/readers/
      reader_roms_lhico

5. See the run cases to further examples, or the 'How to make a run' file to the first steps.

6. This framework was based on OpenDrift model (https://opendrift.github.io/index.html).
